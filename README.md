# Financial Analysis

I thought to create this project for two main reasons:

- I want to demonstrate my data analysis skills and revise what I have previously worked on.
- I felt like I needed to understand the patterns I had in terms of spending, I wanted to create my own dashboard to see where most of my money was going and where are the areas I need to pay attention to.

I know that there are probably a thousand applications/services that would help me in understanding my patterns, but this is so that I can practice my own knowledge and improve on my skills where needed.

## Graphs needed:

1. How much money was spent on each trip I took over the past 2 years. (Column chart)
2. An overall graph showing money spent on each spending category. (Pie chart)
3. How much money was spent on general category (Travel, Assistance, Savings, Daily life)
4. Spending per year/month. (Line chart)
5. Credit per year/month. (Line chart)
6. Debit vs Credit per year/month. (Column chart)
7. Most active months (yearly), highest volume of transactions.(Column Chart)
8. Expense
